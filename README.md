# Features
- Implementes RSpec matcher interface as a module.
- Registers matcher with RSpec.
- It is stable in contrast to RSpec::Matchers::BaseMatcher.
- Well tested and documented.

# Requirements

0. [MRI 2.1.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

# Setup

For a secure install, type the following (recommended):

    gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pekhee/rspec-matcher/master/pekhee.pem)
    gem install rspec-matcher --trust-policy MediumSecurity

NOTE: A HighSecurity trust policy would be best but MediumSecurity enables signed gem verification while
allowing the installation of unsigned dependencies since they are beyond the scope of this gem.

For an insecure install, type the following (not recommended):

    gem install rspec-matcher

Add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem "rspec-matcher"

# Usage

      def match
        actual.nil?
      end

      def failure_message
        "expected #{expected} to be nil"
      end
    end

    expect(nil).to be_nil
